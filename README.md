# Project: Education-Statistics-From-World-Bank (EDA)

## Overview:
This project focuses on data preprocessing, with a specific emphasis on handling missing values in a dataset. While the full exploratory data analysis (EDA) is not conducted here, the groundwork is laid for further analysis, which can be expanded by merging multiple data sources for a more comprehensive evaluation.

## Objective:
The main goal of this project was to clean and preprocess the data by filling missing values. The project uses a single data frame, and the approach is primarily focused on handling gaps in the data. Further analysis could involve merging additional data sources for deeper insights.

## Key Steps:
1. **Data Cleaning**: The primary task involved filling in missing values within the dataset.
2. **Handling Missing Data**: Various techniques were explored to address missing values, such as imputation or removal, depending on the data type and context.
3. **Future Potential**: The analysis could be expanded to include more complex EDA once the data is fully preprocessed and additional data sources are integrated.

## Results:
While no complete EDA is presented, the filling of missing data is a crucial step towards making the dataset suitable for deeper analysis. If the project evolves into a more comprehensive EDA, merging additional data sources could lead to more robust findings.

## Next Steps:
- Merging the available data frames for a comprehensive analysis.
- Expanding the exploratory data analysis (EDA) to include various statistical and visual techniques.
- Developing predictive models or other advanced analytics, depending on the project's direction.

Feel free to explore and adapt the code for your own analysis or data cleaning projects.
